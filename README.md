# Template for Drupal projects hosted on amazee.io

This project template should provide a kickstart for managing your site dependencies with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). It is based on the [original Drupal Composer Template](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project), but includes everything necessary to run on amazee.io (either the local development environment or on amazee.io servers.)

Furthermore, it is built on top of a Drupal base image which means that your Drupal Core version will be automatically managed by the upstream repository which is checked for version updates every time your site is deployed, when you add or update packages using composer.


## Requirements

* [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/).
* [pygmy](https://docs.amazee.io/local_docker_development/pygmy.html) `gem install pygmy` (you might need sudo for this depending on your ruby configuration)

## Local environment setup

1. Checkout project repo and confirm the path is in docker's file sharing config - https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#file-sharing

```
git clone https://github.com/amazeeio/drupal-example.git drupal8-lagoon && cd $_
```

2. Make sure you don't have anything running on port 80 on the host machine (like a web server) then run `pygmy up`

3. Build and start the build images

```
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec cli composer install
```

4. Visit the new site @ `http://drupal-example-multisite1.docker.amazee.io`

* If any steps fail you're safe to rerun from any point,
starting again from the beginning will just reconfirm the changes.

## What does the template do?

When installing the given `composer.json` some tasks are taken care of:

* Drupal will be installed in the `web`-directory.
* Autoloader is implemented to use the generated composer autoloader in `vendor/autoload.php`,
  instead of the one provided by Drupal (`web/vendor/autoload.php`).
* Modules (packages of type `drupal-module`) will be placed in `web/modules/contrib/`
* Themes (packages of type `drupal-theme`) will be placed in `web/themes/contrib/`
* Profiles (packages of type `drupal-profile`) will be placed in `web/profiles/contrib/`
* Creates the `web/sites/default/files`-directory.
* Latest version of drush is installed locally for use at `vendor/bin/drush`.
* Latest version of [Drupal Console](http://www.drupalconsole.com) is installed locally for use at `vendor/bin/drupal`.

## Where do I place my custom settings, modules, themes, etc.

This template aims to check into SVC _only_ those _custom_ files required by your project. As such you'll note that there are only a few directories available in your local development directory.
These are then mapped into the appropriate directories inside the container.

* `/modules` is mapped to `/App/web/modules/custom`
* `/themes` is mapped to `/App/web/themes/custom`
* `/sites/default` is mapped to `/App/web/sites/default`
* `/config` is mapped to `/App/config/sync`


## Updating Drupal Core

Drupal core updates are taken care of by the upstream project.
There should be no reason to update core manually.


## FAQ

### Should I commit the contrib modules I download?

Composer recommends **no**. They provide [argumentation against but also
workarounds if a project decides to do it anyway](https://getcomposer.org/doc/faqs/should-i-commit-the-dependencies-in-my-vendor-directory.md).

### Should I commit the scaffolding files?

The [drupal-scaffold](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-scaffold) plugin can download the scaffold files (like
index.php, update.php, â€¦) to the web/ directory of your project. If you have not customized those files you could choose
to not check them into your version control system (e.g. git). If that is the case for your project it might be
convenient to automatically run the drupal-scaffold plugin after every install or update of your project. You can
achieve that by registering `@drupal-scaffold` as a post-install and post-update command in your composer.json:

```json
"scripts": {
    "drupal-scaffold": "DrupalComposer\\DrupalScaffold\\Plugin::scaffold",
    "post-install-cmd": [
        "@drupal-scaffold",
        "..."
    ],
    "post-update-cmd": [
        "@drupal-scaffold",
        "..."
    ]
},
```
### How can I apply patches to downloaded modules?

If you need to apply patches (depending on the project being modified, a pull
request is often a better solution), you can do so with the
[composer-patches](https://github.com/cweagans/composer-patches) plugin.

To add a patch to drupal module foobar insert the patches section in the extra
section of composer.json:
```json
"extra": {
    "patches": {
        "drupal/foobar": {
            "Patch description": "URL to patch"
        }
    }
}
```
